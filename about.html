            <p>
                NOVA began in 2018 when a group of college students noticed a shift 
                in how the internet was approached by the general public. Rather than 
                heeding the warnings of never putting your real information online and 
                following stranger danger rules, users online were starting to use the 
                internet like a diary.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Operations</h2>
            <p>
                At NOVA, we value freedom and privacy when it comes to traversing the vast 
                landscape the internet has to offer. We do so without sacrificing the safety 
                of any individual or community. We embrace the internet not as a space to be 
                feared, but as a space to be harnessed. Our mission is to provide the tools 
                and knowledge necessary for people to safely explore the internet, steering 
                away from any potential dangers. Go on, fly away, and build your personal planet.
